#**cd**

##No arguments:

![Image](cd1.png)

The working directory was previously on [user@sahara ~]$

When I used cd, nothing changed because I was "continously delivering" to nothing.
Since there are no arguments in "cd" yet, we are returned to nothing.
The output isn't an error because I was given a new line to write again with [user@sahara ~].

##Path to directory:

![Image](cd2.png)

The working directory was previously on [user@sahara ~]$

When I used cd lecture1 which is adding a directory in the argument of cd, the code didn't change anything in the file but changed my location in the terminal. so it became [user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ because I was continously delivered to lecture. Now if I type ls, I can see all the files within lecture1.
The output isn't a error because I was given a fresh command line saying user@sahara ~/lecture1]$

##Path to a file:

![Image](cd3.png)

The working directory was previously on [user@sahara ~/lecture1]$

When I used cd messages, I moved from the directory lecture1 to /messages which changed my termimal prompt to [user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$. This only changed the output I get from ls because I'm now in a different space than I was previously.
The output isn't a error because I was given a new command line that directly spells out where I am.
